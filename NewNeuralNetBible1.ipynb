       "  u'Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.',\n",
       "  u'And when they came to him, he said to them:  You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,  serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews;  how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,  testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.',\n",
       "  u'And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,  except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.',\n",
       "  u'But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.',\n",
       "  u'And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.',\n",
       "  u'Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you,  for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.',\n",
       "  u'Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.',\n",
       "  u'I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;  and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.',\n",
       "  u'Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears.',\n",
       "  u'And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.',\n",
       "  u\"I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.\",\n",
       "  u'You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.',\n",
       "  u'In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.',\n",
       "  u'And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.',\n",
       "  u'And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him,  being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again.',\n",
       "  u'And they accompanied him to the ship.'],\n",
       " 'ac_21': [u'   And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.',\n",
       "  u'And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.',\n",
       "  u'When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo.',\n",
       "  u'And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days.',\n",
       "  u'And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.',\n",
       "  u'When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city.',\n",
       "  u'And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed  and said farewell to one another.',\n",
       "  u'Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.',\n",
       "  u'When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.',\n",
       "  u'On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.',\n",
       "  u'He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.',\n",
       "  u'While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.',\n",
       "  u\"And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.\",\n",
       "  u'When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.',\n",
       "  u'Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart?',\n",
       "  u'For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.',\n",
       "  u'And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, Let the will of the Lord be done.',\n",
       "  u'After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.',\n",
       "  u'And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.',\n",
       "  u'When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.',\n",
       "  u'On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.',\n",
       "  u'After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.',\n",
       "  u'And when they heard it, they glorified God.',\n",
       "  u'And they said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed.',\n",
       "  u'They are all zealous for the law,  and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.',\n",
       "  u'What then is to be done?',\n",
       "  u'They will certainly hear that you have come.',\n",
       "  u'Do therefore what we tell you.',\n",
       "  u'We have four men who are under a vow;  take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads.',\n",
       "  u'Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law.',\n",
       "  u'But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.',\n",
       "  u'Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.',\n",
       "  u'When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,  crying out, Men of Israel, help!',\n",
       "  u'This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place.',\n",
       "  u'Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.',\n",
       "  u'For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.',\n",
       "  u'Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together.',\n",
       "  u'They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.',\n",
       "  u'And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.',\n",
       "  u'He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them.',\n",
       "  u'And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.',\n",
       "  u'Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains.',\n",
       "  u'He inquired who he was and what he had done.',\n",
       "  u'Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another.',\n",
       "  u'And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.',\n",
       "  u'And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,  for the mob of the people followed, crying out, Away with him!',\n",
       "  u'As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, May I say something to you?',\n",
       "  u'And he said, Do you know Greek?',\n",
       "  u'Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?',\n",
       "  u'Paul replied, I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city.',\n",
       "  u'I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.',\n",
       "  u'And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people.',\n",
       "  u'And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:'],\n",
       " 'ac_22': [u'   Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.',\n",
       "  u'And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet.',\n",
       "  u'And he said:    I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.',\n",
       "  u'I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,  as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness.',\n",
       "  u'From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.',\n",
       "  u'As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.',\n",
       "  u'And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?',\n",
       "  u'And I answered, Who are you, Lord?',\n",
       "  u'And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.',\n",
       "  u'Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.',\n",
       "  u'And I said, What shall I do, Lord?',\n",
       "  u'And the Lord said to me, Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.',\n",
       "  u'And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.',\n",
       "  u'And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,  came to me, and standing by me said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight.',\n",
       "  u'And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.',\n",
       "  u'And he said, The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;  for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.',\n",
       "  u'And now why do you wait?',\n",
       "  u'Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.',\n",
       "  u'When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance  and saw him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.',\n",
       "  u'And I said, Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.',\n",
       "  u'And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.',\n",
       "  u'And he said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.',\n",
       "  u'Up to this word they listened to him.',\n",
       "  u'Then they raised their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth!',\n",
       "  u'For he should not be allowed to live.',\n",
       "  u'And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,  the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.',\n",
       "  u'But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?',\n",
       "  u'When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, What are you about to do?',\n",
       "  u'For this man is a Roman citizen.',\n",
       "  u'So the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?',\n",
       "  u'And he said, Yes.',\n",
       "  u'The tribune answered, I bought this citizenship for a large sum.',\n",
       "  u'Paul said, But I am a citizen by birth.',\n",
       "  u'So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.',\n",
       "  u'But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.'],\n",
       " 'ac_23': [u'   And looking intently at the council, Paul said, Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.',\n",
       "  u'And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.',\n",
       "  u'Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall!',\n",
       "  u'Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?',\n",
       "  u\"Those who stood by said, Would you revile God's high priest?\",\n",
       "  u'And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.',\n",
       "  u'Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.',\n",
       "  u'It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.',\n",
       "  u'And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.',\n",
       "  u'For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.',\n",
       "  u\"Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, We find nothing wrong in this man.\",\n",
       "  u'What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?',\n",
       "  u'And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.',\n",
       "  u'The following night the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome.',\n",
       "  u'When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.',\n",
       "  u'There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.',\n",
       "  u'They went to the chief priests and elders and said, We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.',\n",
       "  u'Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly.',\n",
       "  u'And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.',\n",
       "  u\"Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.\",\n",
       "  u'Paul called one of the centurions and said, Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him.',\n",
       "  u'So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you.',\n",
       "  u'The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me?',\n",
       "  u'And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.',\n",
       "  u'But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him.',\n",
       "  u'And now they are ready, waiting for your consent.',\n",
       "  u'So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, Tell no one that you have informed me of these things.',\n",
       "  u'Then he called two of the centurions and said, Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night.',\n",
       "  u'Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.',\n",
       "  u'And he wrote a letter to this effect:    Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.',\n",
       "  u'This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.',\n",
       "  u'And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.',\n",
       "  u'I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.',\n",
       "  u'And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him.',\n",
       "  u'So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.',\n",
       "  u'And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.',\n",
       "  u'When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.',\n",
       "  u'On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from.',\n",
       "  u'And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,  he said, I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.',\n",
       "  u\"And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.\"],\n",
       " 'ac_24': [u'   And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus.',\n",
       "  u'They laid before the governor their case against Paul.',\n",
       "  u'And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:  Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,  in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.',\n",
       "  u'But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.',\n",
       "  u'For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.',\n",
       "  u'He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.',\n",
       "  u'By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him.',\n",
       "  u'The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.',\n",
       "  u'And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:  Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.',\n",
       "  u'You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,  and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.',\n",
       "  u'Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.',\n",
       "  u'But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,  having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.',\n",
       "  u'So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.',\n",
       "  u'Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.',\n",
       "  u'While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult.',\n",
       "  u'But some Jews from Asia  they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.',\n",
       "  u'Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,  other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.',\n",
       "  u'But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case.',\n",
       "  u'Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.',\n",
       "  u'After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.',\n",
       "  u'And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, Go away for the present.',\n",
       "  u'When I get an opportunity I will summon you.',\n",
       "  u'At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul.',\n",
       "  u'So he sent for him often and conversed with him.',\n",
       "  u'When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus.',\n",
       "  u'And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.'],\n",
       " 'ac_25': [u'   Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.',\n",
       "  u'And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,  asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalembecause they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.',\n",
       "  u'Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.',\n",
       "  u'So, said he, let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him.',\n",
       "  u'After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea.',\n",
       "  u'And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.',\n",
       "  u'When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove.',\n",
       "  u'Paul argued in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense.',\n",
       "  u'But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?',\n",
       "  u\"But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried.\",\n",
       "  u'To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well.',\n",
       "  u'If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death.',\n",
       "  u'But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them.',\n",
       "  u'I appeal to Caesar.',\n",
       "  u'Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.',\n",
       "  u'Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.',\n",
       "  u\"And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, There is a man left prisoner by Felix,  and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.\",\n",
       "  u'I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.',\n",
       "  u'So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.',\n",
       "  u'When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed.',\n",
       "  u'Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.',\n",
       "  u'Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.',\n",
       "  u'But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.',\n",
       "  u'Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would like to hear the man myself.',\n",
       "  u'Tomorrow, said he, you will hear him.',\n",
       "  u'So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city.',\n",

       "  u'There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.',\n",
       "  u'Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.',\n",
       "  u'Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.',\n",
       "  u'The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework.',\n",
       "  u'There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.',\n",
       "  u'He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple.',\n",

       "  u'And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work.',\n",
       "  u'Thus the work of the pillars was finished.',\n",

       "  u'The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.',\n",
       "  u'The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.',\n",
       "  u'There were four supports at the four corners of each stand.',\n",
       "  u'The supports were of one piece with the stands.',\n",
       "  u'And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.',\n",
       "  u'And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.',\n",
       "  u'After this manner he made the ten stands.',\n",
       "  u'All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.',\n",
       "  u'And he made ten basins of bronze.',\n",
       "  u'Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.',\n",
       "  u'And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house.',\n",
       "  u'And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.',\n",
       "  u'Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins.',\n",
       "  u'So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the :  the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;  and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;  the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands;  and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.',\n",
       "  u'Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the , which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.',\n",
       "  u'In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.',\n",
       "  u'And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.',\n",
       "  u'So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the : the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,  the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;  the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.',\n",
       "  u'Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the was finished.',\n",

       "  u'The house that King Solomon built for the was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.',\n",
       "  u'The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.',\n",
       "  u'And he made for the house windows with recessed frames.',\n",
       "  u'He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary.',\n",
       "  u'And he made side chambers all around.',\n",
       "  u'The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad.',\n",
       "  u'For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.',\n",
       "  u'When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.',\n",
       "  u'The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.',\n",
       "  u'So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar.',\n",
       "  u'He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.',\n",
       "  u'Now the word of the came to Solomon,  Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.',\n",

       "  u'From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.',\n",
       "  u'He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place.',\n",
       "  u'The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.',\n",
       "  u'The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers.',\n",

       "  u'The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.',\n",

       "  u'For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided.',\n",

       "  u'He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.',\n",
       "  u'So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,  and two doors of cypress wood.',\n",
       "  u'The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.',\n",
       "  u'On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.',\n",
       "  u'He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams.',\n",
       "  u'In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the was laid, in the month of Ziv.',\n",

       "  u'And no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen on all peoples.',\n",
       "  u'All the officials of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal agents also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.',\n",
       "  u\"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful.\",\n",
       "  u'The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.',\n",
       "  u'In Susa the citadel itself the Jews killed and destroyed 500 men,  and also killed Parshandatha and Dalphon and Aspatha  and Poratha and Adalia and Aridatha  and Parmashta and Arisai and Aridai and Vaizatha,  the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they laid no hand on the plunder.',\n",
       "  u'That very day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was reported to the king.',\n",
       "  u'And the king said to Queen Esther, In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed 500 men and also the ten sons of Haman.',\n",
       "  u\"What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces!\",\n",
       "  u'Now what is your wish?',\n",
       "  u'It shall be granted you.',\n",
       "  u'And what further is your request?',\n",
       "  u'It shall be fulfilled.',\n",
       "  u\"And Esther said, If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict.\",\n",
       "  u'And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.',\n",
       "  u'So the king commanded this to be done.',\n",
       "  u'A decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.',\n",
       "  u'The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they killed 300 men in Susa, but they laid no hands on the plunder.',\n",
       "  u\"Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies and killed 75,000 of those who hated them, but they laid no hands on the plunder.\",\n",
       "  u'This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.',\n",
       "  u'But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness.',\n",
       "  u'Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the rural towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting, as a holiday, and as a day on which they send gifts of food to one another.',\n",
       "  u'And Mordecai recorded these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,  obliging them to keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,  as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and gifts to the poor.',\n",
       "  u'So the Jews accepted what they had started to do, and what Mordecai had written to them.',\n",
       "  u'For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur (that is, cast lots), to crush and to destroy them.',\n",
       "  u'But when it came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his evil plan that he had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.',\n",
       "  u'Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur.',\n",
       "  u'Therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had happened to them,  the Jews firmly obligated themselves and their offspring and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year,  that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every clan, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.',\n",
       "  u'Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.',\n",
       "  u'Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, in words of peace and truth,  that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther obligated them, and as they had obligated themselves and their offspring, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting.',\n",
       "  u'The command of Queen Esther confirmed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.'],\n",
       " 'est_1': [u'   Now in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces,  in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa, the capital,  in the third year of his reign he gave a feast for all his officials and servants.',\n",
       "  u'The army of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces were before him,  while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his greatness for many days, 180 days.',\n",
       "  u\"And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa, the citadel, both great and small, a feast lasting for seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace.\",\n",
       "  u'There were white cotton curtains and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rods and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones.',\n",
       "  u'Drinks were served in golden vessels, vessels of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.',\n",
       "  u'And drinking was according to this edict: There is no compulsion.',\n",
       "  u'For the king had given orders to all the staff of his palace to do as each man desired.',\n",
       "  u'Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women in the palace that belonged to King Ahasuerus.',\n",
       "  u'On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha and Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,  to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty, for she was lovely to look at.',\n",
       "  u\"But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command delivered by the eunuchs.\",\n",
       "  u'At this the king became enraged, and his anger burned within him.',\n",
       "  u\"Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment,  the men next to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom):  According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?\",\n",
       "  u'Then Memucan said in the presence of the king and the officials, Not only against the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also against all the officials and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.',\n",
       "  u\"For the queen's behavior will be made known to all women, causing them to look at their husbands with contempt, since they will say, King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.\",\n",
       "  u\"This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will say the same to all the king's officials, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty.\",\n",
       "  u'If it please the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be repealed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus.',\n",
       "  u'And let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.',\n",
       "  u'So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, for it is vast, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.',\n",
       "  u'This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed.',\n",
       "  u'He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be master in his own household and speak according to the language of his people.'],\n",
       " 'est_2': [u'   After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.',\n",
       "  u\"Then the king's young men who attended him said, Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.\",\n",
       "  u\"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital, under custody of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women.\",\n",
       "  u'Let their cosmetics be given them.',\n",
       "  u'And let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.',\n",
       "  u'This pleased the king, and he did so.',\n",
       "  u'Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,  who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away.',\n",
       "  u'He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother.',\n",
       "  u'The young woman had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.',\n",
       "  u\"So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many young women were gathered in Susa the citadel in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women.\",\n",
       "  u'And the young woman pleased him and won his favor.',\n",
       "  u\"And he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her portion of food, and with seven chosen young women from the king's palace, and advanced her and her young women to the best place in the harem.\",\n",
       "  u'Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mordecai had commanded her not to make it known.',\n",
       "  u'And every day Mordecai walked in front of the court of the harem to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.',\n",
       "  u\"Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women  when the young woman went in to the king in this way, she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.\",\n",
       "  u\"In the evening she would go in, and in the morning she would return to the second harem in custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who was in charge of the concubines.\",\n",
       "  u'She would not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.',\n",
       "  u\"When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised.\",\n",
       "  u'Now Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her.',\n",
       "  u'And when Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,  the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.',\n",
       "  u\"Then the king gave a great feast for all his officials and servants; it was Esther's feast.\",\n",
       "  u'He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces and gave gifts with royal generosity.',\n",
       "  u\"Now when the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.\",\n",
       "  u'Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mordecai had commanded her, for Esther obeyed Mordecai just as when she was brought up by him.',\n",
       "  u\"In those days, as Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.\",\n",
       "  u'And this came to the knowledge of Mordecai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai.',\n",
       "  u'When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows.',\n",
       "  u'And it was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.'],\n",
       " 'est_3': [u'   After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, and advanced him and set his throne above all the officials who were with him.',\n",
       "  u\"And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him.\",\n",
       "  u'But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.',\n",
       "  u\"Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king's command?\",\n",
       "  u\"And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai's words would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.\",\n",
       "  u'And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with fury.',\n",
       "  u'But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone.',\n",
       "  u'So, as they had made known to him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus.',\n",
       "  u'In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, they cast lots) before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.',\n",
       "  u'Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom.',\n",
       "  u\"Their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not to the king's profit to tolerate them.\",\n",
       "  u\"If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries.\",\n",
       "  u'So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews.',\n",
       "  u'And the king said to Haman, The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you.',\n",
       "  u\"Then the king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the officials of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language.\",\n",
       "  u\"It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king's signet ring.\",\n",
       "  u\"Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with instruction to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.\",\n",
       "  u'A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.',\n",
       "  u'The couriers went out hurriedly by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the citadel.',\n",
       "  u'And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.'],\n",
       " 'est_4': [u'   When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and he cried out with a loud and bitter cry.',\n",
       "  u\"He went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one was allowed to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth.\",\n",
       "  u\"And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and many of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.\",\n",
       "  u\"When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed.\",\n",
       "  u'She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.',\n",
       "  u\"Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.\",\n",
       "  u\"Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,  and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.\",\n",
       "  u'Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people.',\n",

       "  u'But as for me, I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.',\n",
       "  u'And they told Mordecai what Esther had said.',\n",
       "  u\"Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, Do not think to yourself that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.\",\n",
       "  u\"For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish.\",\n",
       "  u'And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?',\n",
       "  u'Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai,  Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.',\n",
       "  u'I and my young women will also fast as you do.',\n",
       "  u'Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law, and if I perish, I perish.',\n",
